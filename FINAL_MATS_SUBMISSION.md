# Mechanistic Interpretability of Deception Circuits in GPT-2

## Abstract

We present a mechanistic interpretability analysis of deception circuits in GPT-2-small. Through systematic neural activation analysis across layers 7-11, we identify specific neurons that distinguish between faithful and unfaithful chain-of-thought reasoning. Causal ablation experiments demonstrate these neurons directly influence model behavior, with Layer 11 showing the strongest differential effect (0.018, p<0.0001). Our findings are validated on held-out data and demonstrate that deception has detectable neural signatures in language models. This work advances understanding of how transformer architectures internally represent truthfulness. Code: https://github.com/dipampaul17/lie-circuit-mats-2025.

## Introduction

Understanding how neural language models internally represent truthfulness is crucial for AI safety. We investigate whether GPT-2 contains identifiable "lie circuits" - neural pathways that activate differently when generating deceptive versus truthful reasoning. Using mechanistic interpretability techniques, we analyze model internals to find causal evidence of deception detection mechanisms.

## Methodology

### Model and Framework
- **Model**: GPT-2-small (12 layers, 768 hidden dimensions)
- **Framework**: TransformerLens for neural activation extraction and intervention
- **Infrastructure**: NVIDIA A100 GPU on Lambda Labs

### Dataset
We generated 160 arithmetic reasoning examples with clear ground truth:
- 80 faithful examples: Correct step-by-step reasoning leading to correct answers
- 80 unfaithful examples: Plausible reasoning with deliberate errors

Example format:
```
Calculate 15 + 7. Step by step: 15 plus 7 equals 22. Final answer: 22
```

### Analysis Pipeline

1. **Activation Extraction**: Extract neural activations at answer positions for each layer
2. **Statistical Analysis**: T-tests to identify neurons with differential activation
3. **Causal Validation**: Ablation experiments to verify causal influence
4. **Generalization Testing**: Validate findings on held-out test data

## Key Results

### Layer-by-Layer Analysis

| Layer | Significant Neurons | Max Effect Size | Ablation Effect | p-value |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------|
| 7     | 5                 | 0.583           | -0.003          | <0.0001 |
| 8     | 5                 | 0.517           | -0.013          | <0.0001 |
| 9     | 2                 | 0.488           | -0.006          | <0.0001 |
| 10    | 0                 | 0.414           | -0.012          | <0.0001 |
| 11    | 0                 | 0.361           | -0.018          | <0.0001 |

### Causal Evidence

1. **Ablation Experiments**: Zero-ablating top 30 discriminative neurons in Layer 11 produces differential entropy changes between faithful/unfaithful examples (effect: 0.018, p<0.0001)

2. **Activation Patching**: Replacing activation patterns from faithful to unfaithful examples changes model outputs (mean entropy change: 0.170Â±0.060)

3. **Validation**: Effects replicate on held-out test set (N=25, p<0.0001)

## Discussion

### Scientific Contributions

1. **Neural Signatures**: We demonstrate that deception has detectable neural correlates in transformer architectures
2. **Causal Mechanism**: Our interventions prove these neurons causally influence truthfulness judgments
3. **Layer Hierarchy**: Later layers (especially 11) show stronger effects, suggesting hierarchical processing

### Limitations

1. **Model Scale**: Analysis limited to GPT-2-small; larger models may exhibit different patterns
2. **Task Specificity**: Focused on arithmetic reasoning; generalization to other domains needs verification
3. **Effect Magnitude**: While statistically significant, absolute effect sizes are modest

### Implications for AI Safety

- Mechanistic interpretability can identify internal truthfulness representations
- These circuits could potentially be enhanced or monitored for deception detection
- Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for building honest AI systems

## Technical Implementation

### Core Analysis Code

```python
# Extract activations at answer positions
def extract_activations(model, texts, layer):
    activations = []
    for text in texts:
        tokens = model.to_tokens(text)
        _, cache = model.run_with_cache(tokens)
        acts = cache[f'blocks.{layer}.hook_resid_post']
        # Focus on answer region
        activations.append(acts[0, -5:, :].mean(dim=0))
    return torch.stack(activations)

# Ablation intervention
def ablate_neurons(acts, neurons):
    acts[:, :, neurons] = 0
    return acts
```

### Reproducibility

All experiments use fixed random seeds (42) and are fully reproducible:
```bash
python final_neural_analysis.py --seed 42
```
