# üö® EMERGENCY 48-HOUR PIVOT PLAN

## The Reality Check

### What We Built (WRONG for MATS)
```python
# Text analysis - NOT mechanistic interpretability
def extract_text_features(text):
    features = {
        'has_wait': 'wait' in text.lower(),
        'has_actually': 'actually' in text.lower(),
        'num_numbers': len(re.findall(r'\d+', text))
    }
    return features
```

**This is computational linguistics, NOT neural circuit analysis!**

### What MATS Wants (REAL Mech Interp)
```python
# Neural network analysis - THIS is mechanistic interpretability
import transformer_lens as tl

model = tl.HookedTransformer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
_, cache = model.run_with_cache(prompt)
layer_9_neurons = cache['blocks.9.mlp.hook_post']  # NEURAL activations
```

## 48-Hour Emergency Pivot Timeline

### Hour 0-6: Setup & Environment ‚úÖ
- [x] Create `real_neural_mech_interp.py` with TransformerLens
- [x] Create deployment script for Lambda GPU
- [ ] Test basic TransformerLens functionality

### Hour 6-12: Data & Baseline
- [ ] Generate arithmetic reasoning examples
- [ ] Extract neural activations from ALL layers
- [ ] Create baseline metrics

### Hour 12-24: Find Neural Circuits
- [ ] Identify discriminative neurons in each layer
- [ ] Focus on layer 9 (our hypothesis)
- [ ] Analyze attention patterns
- [ ] Find MLP neurons that detect deception

### Hour 24-36: Causal Interventions
- [ ] Implement zero ablation on target neurons
- [ ] Test activation patching between examples
- [ ] Measure KL divergence of outputs
- [ ] Verify causal effects

### Hour 36-48: Package & Submit
- [ ] Generate clear visualizations
- [ ] Write up REAL neural findings
- [ ] Create comparison: before (text) vs after (neural)
- [ ] Submit with honesty about pivot

## Key Commands

### Deploy to Lambda
```bash
python3 deploy_neural_to_lambda.py
```

### Run Locally (if TransformerLens works)
```bash
python3 real_neural_mech_interp.py
```

### Expected Output
```
üß† REAL NEURAL CIRCUIT ANALYSIS
‚úÖ Found 47 discriminative neurons in layer 9
‚úÖ Ablation KL divergence: 0.0234
‚úÖ Attention differences in layers [7, 8, 9]
```

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Must analyze NEURAL NETWORK INTERNALS**
   - Not text patterns
   - Not output probabilities
   - Actual neuron activations

2. **Must show CAUSAL EFFECTS**
   - Ablation changes behavior
   - Patching transfers properties
   - Not just correlation

3. **Must use PROPER TOOLS**
   - TransformerLens (or similar)
   - Hook into model internals
   - Analyze weights/activations

## Honest Assessment

**Success Probability: 25%** (up from 15% with this plan)

Why still low:
- Very rushed implementation
- No time for proper validation
- Learning TransformerLens on the fly
- GPU setup challenges

But it's better than:
- Submitting text analysis (0% chance)
- Not trying at all

## Alternative: Withdraw Gracefully

If Lambda fails or TransformerLens won't install:

```
Dear MATS Committee,

Upon review, I realize my submission analyzed text patterns 
rather than neural circuits. This represents a fundamental 
misunderstanding of mechanistic interpretability.

I am withdrawing my application to resubmit when I have 
genuine neural network analysis.

Thank you for your consideration.
```

## GO/NO-GO Decision Points

### After 12 hours:
- ‚úÖ TransformerLens running? Continue
- ‚ùå Still debugging setup? Consider withdrawal

### After 24 hours:
- ‚úÖ Found discriminative neurons? Continue
- ‚ùå No neural patterns? Withdraw

### After 36 hours:
- ‚úÖ Causal effects demonstrated? Submit
- ‚ùå No clear results? Withdraw gracefully

## Bottom Line

We built the wrong thing. This pivot attempts to build the right thing in 48 hours. It's ambitious but represents our only chance for MATS.

**Next Step**: Run `deploy_neural_to_lambda.py` and pray the GPU works! üöÄ
